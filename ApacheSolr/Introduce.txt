 Text search is one of the most significant feature of most applications., from client installed software to web sites to the web itself, all need to have search. Basically there is huge difference between the best search experiences and the mediocre and bad ones. If a robust application is being designed,  then it's got to have great search features. If thisis left to the capabilities of a database, then it's near impossible that anyone would get great search experience, because it's not going to have features that users come to expect in a great search. With Solr, the leading open source search server,you can use it to for host of features from highlighting search results to spell-checking to faceting.

One of the search platfom for Enterprise system is Solr from the Apache Lucene project and its an open source framework. Its major features include powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database integration, and rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling. Providing distributed search and index replication, Solr is highly scalable.

Solr is written in Java and runs as a standalone full-text search server within a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat . Solr uses the Lucene Java search library at its core for full-text indexing and search, and has REST-like HTTP/XML and JSON APIs that make it easy to use from virtually any programming language. Solr's powerful external configuration allows it to be tailored to almost any type of application without Java coding, and it has an extensive plugin architecture when more advanced customization is required.
 
Apache Lucene and Apache Solr are both produced by the same Apache Software Foundation development team since the two projects were merged in 2010. It is common to refer to the technology or products as Lucene/Solr or Solr/Lucene.
